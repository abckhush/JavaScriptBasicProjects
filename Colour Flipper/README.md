# Color Flipper

## Overview
This simple web application demonstrates the basics of JavaScript by flipping colors in two different ways: Simple and Hex.

1. Simple Color Flipper
In the Simple Color Flipper, you can change the background color by clicking the "Flip Color" button. The button cycles through a predefined set of colors, providing a quick and easy way to change the background.

2. Hex Color Flipper
The Hex Color Flipper generates random hexadecimal color codes and displays them as the background color. Each time you click the "Flip Color" button, a new color is generated, allowing for an almost infinite number of color possibilities.

## Usage
To use the Color Flipper application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. From there, you can interact with the Simple and Hex components to see the color flipping in action.
